# Prework: Intro to Web Development (WEB101)

In WEB101, each week you're going to be working towards creating a single page website focused on social impact for good. We define social impact for good to mean the ways and means by which members of a community can bring about change for societal good. This through-course project will give you the opportunity to create a web app centered on a cause you are passionate about. By the end of the course, you'll have an interactive website that connects your topic with all of the skills you've learned in the class!

Your goal for this Prework is to plan your website. You can start off by brainstorming ideas on what topic you want your website to cover. Then, once you've landed on one, you must create your wireframe. You can create your wireframe any way you want - whether it's starting off with a sketch, or creating one online, you are in charge of how to bring your ideas to life! Lastly, we want to hear about your ideas!
