## Intro to Web Development

## 📚 Course Description

👋 Welcome to Intro to Web Development (WEB101), a project-based exploration of web development! This course is the first in our Full Stack Web Development series. In this course, you will learn frontend web fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At the conclusion of this course, you will have created a working dynamic web application that displays all the web dev skills you've learned so far.

This course is a beginner-friendly introductory course that requires no prior knowledge. While previous coding experience with any programming language may be helpful to you, it is not required for successful participation in this course.

**Theme:** In this course, you will develop a website centered around a cause you care deeply about. The Activism Project is threaded throughout the course. You will apply your learnings to the project, adding on new features to your website each week. We are excited to see what you develop!

This course includes the following features:

- 🖥 **In-class and Online Support** regardless of type of exercise.
- 🧑🏾‍🏫 **Guided Activities** where an instructor or tech fellow introduces you to a skill and walks you through an implementation.
- 👷🏽‍♀️ **The Through-Course Project** where you can apply the skills you learn to create something truly yours.
- 👥 **Demo Day** where you will share your completed website with the class!
